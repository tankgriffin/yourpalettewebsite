# Complete Website Optimisation Framework

## Part 1: Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) Framework

### 1. Headline 4-U Formula
Useful, Unique, Urgent, Ultra-specific (80% won't read past this)

### 2. Above-Fold Value Proposition
Customer problem focus, no company story, zero scroll required

### 3. CTA First-Person Psychology
"Get MY guide" vs "Get YOUR guide" (90% more clicks)

### 4. 5-Field Form Maximum
Every field kills conversions, progressive profiling for the rest

### 5. Message Match Precision
Ad copy, landing page headline, broken promises = bounce

### 6. Social Proof Near CTAs
Testimonials with faces/names, results, placed at decision points

### 7. Cognitive Bias Stack
Loss aversion (fear), social proof (FOMO), anchoring (pricing)

### 8. PAS Copy Framework
Problem → Agitate → Solve, emotion before logic

### 9. Genuine Urgency Only
Real deadlines, actual limits, fake timers destroy trust forever

### 10. Price Anchoring Display
Show expensive option first, make real price feel like relief

### 11. Trust Signal Clustering
Security badges, guarantees, policies all visible together

### 12. Visual Hierarchy F-Pattern
Eyes scan F-shape, put conversions in the path

### 13. Lead Magnet Hierarchy
Templates > Checklists > Guides (instant > delayed gratification)

### 14. Objection Preemption
Address top 3 concerns before they think them, FAQ near CTA

### 15. Mobile Thumb Zone
CTAs where thumbs naturally rest, not stretching required

### 16. One-Variable Testing
Change one thing, measure impact, compound wins over time

### 17. Post-Conversion Momentum
Thank you page sells next step while excitement peaks

### 18. Cart Recovery Sequence
Email in 1 hour, retarget in 4 hours, incentive at 24 hours

### 19. Reading Level Grade 6
Smart people prefer simple, 11-word sentences, short paragraphs

### 20. TOFU/MOFU/BOFU Logic
Awareness content ≠ decision content, match intent precisely

### 21. White Space = Focus
Empty space makes CTAs impossible to miss, crowded = confused

### 22. Benefit-First Language
Features tell, benefits sell, transformations compel

### 23. Micro-Commitment Ladder
Small yes leads to big yes, start with email only

### 24. Performance Tracking Stack
Heatmaps show problems, recordings show why, events show what

### 25. Weekly Optimisation Ritual
Review metrics Monday, test Tuesday, iterate or scale

## Part 2: 5x5 Technical SEO Optimisation Checklist

### URLs

URLs help search engines understand content and structure. Clear, relevant URLs improve indexing, click-through rates, and rankings.

**When optimising a page, check that:**
- [ ] URL is appropriate length (50-60 characters is the sweet spot, 80+ is too high)
- [ ] URL has appropriate structure
- [ ] URL includes target keyword or implies it
- [ ] URL is typo-free
- [ ] URL has no underscores

**Examples of great URLs:**
- `/services/criminal-law/toowoomba/`
- `/services/criminal-law/assault/`

**Examples of poor URLs:**
- `/services/criminal-lawyer-toowoomba/drink-driving-lawyer-toowoomba/`
- `/about/services/assault-lawyer/`

### Meta Titles and Descriptions

Meta titles and descriptions help search engines and users understand page content. They influence click-through rates, which can improve organic performance.

**When optimising a page, check that:**
- [ ] Meta title includes target keyword or implies it
- [ ] Meta title is between 40-60 characters in length
- [ ] Meta description is between 120-156 characters in length
- [ ] Keyword-relevant copy is used in meta description

**Tools:**
- [Meta Length Checker Tool](https://serpsim.com/)

**Examples of great meta titles:**
- "Is it Worth Buying a Hail-Damaged Caravan? (7/10 Insurers Say No)"
- "Criminal Lawyers Toowoomba | Brooke Winter Solicitors"
- "Affordable Family Lawyers Brisbane | JP Family Law"

**Examples of great meta descriptions:**
- "Need a trusted family lawyer in Brisbane? Our experienced team helps with separation, parenting, and property matters. Book your consultation today."

### Images & Alt Text

Images contribute to user experience and SEO. Search engines rely on alt text to understand images.

**When optimising a page, check that:**
- [ ] Images are compressed and properly formatted (ideally under 200KB each)
- [ ] Images are formatted as WebP instead of large JPEGs or PNGs
- [ ] File names are descriptive and include relevant keywords
- [ ] Alt text clearly describes the image (5-10 words)
- [ ] Alt text includes relevant keyword if natural
- [ ] No missing alt attributes on any `<img>` tag

**Examples of good image optimisation:**
- 170KB WebP image: `family-lawyer-consulting-client.webp`
- Alt text: "Family lawyer consulting with clients in Brisbane office"

**Examples of poor image optimisation:**
- 1.4MB JPEG: `wp-image-upload1234.jpeg`

- [ ] Logical linking structure exists

**Examples of good internal links:**
- "We also provide divorce services in Brisbane" (family law page → divorce page)
- "It's good to know what to expect during a criminal law case" (service page → blog article)

**Avoid:**
- "Click here to learn more"
- "Read more here"
- Linking 10+ times to same page
